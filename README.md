# Number Guesser
## Project #27 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
Number Guesser is a game where the user and the computer choose a number between 1 and 9. The winner is the player whose number is closest to the target number, which is randomised every round. In this project I created 4 functions to make the game work as intended.
## What I Learned
  - The logic behind updating the game's round number and score
  - Comparing two numbers to determine which is closest to the target number
  - Using the Math.abs function to return absolute number values
